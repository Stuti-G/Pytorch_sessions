# UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION:
In classification problems, when probability of one class becomes slightly/barely higher than the rest of the classes. Hence, instead of choosing one class it needs to conclude that the prediction is uncertain, or the model is not sure about the prediction.
Thatâ€™s when the concept of uncertainty comes into the picture.

## Kinds of uncertainty:
TOTAL UNCERTAINTY = DATA UNCERTAINTY + MODEL UNCERTAINTY
### Data Uncertainty:
Uncertainty of the data also know as irreducable uncertainty
### Model Uncertainty:
Uncertainty in the model also known as reducable uncertainty.

## In this session we will try to understand why there is a requirment to introduce uncertainty in the model, using pytorch on MNIST dataset
