# UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION:
In classification problems, when probability of one class becomes slightly/barely higher than the rest of the classes. Hence, instead of choosing one class it needs to conclude that the prediction is uncertain, or the model is not sure about the prediction.
Thatâ€™s when the concept of uncertainty comes into the picture.

## Kinds of uncertainty:
TOTAL UNCERTAINTY = DATA UNCERTAINTY + MODEL UNCERTAINTY

In this session we will try to understand why there is a requirment to introduce uncertainty in the model, using pytorch on MNIST dataset
